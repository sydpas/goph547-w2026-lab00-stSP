# GOPH 547 -- Lab 00
Instructor: Brandon Karchewski, Author: Sydney Pasloski, UCID: 30178579
## General overview.
This lab sets software for a general repo and demonstrates examples of numpy and matplotlib. More specifically, it 
creates various types of arrays, vecctors, and performs summation, element-wise multiplication, the dot product and the 
cross product on arrays. It then loads an image of a rock canyon and performs matplotlib transforms on it, and then 
finally graphs the RGB colour values on a plot in relation to the x and y coordinates.
